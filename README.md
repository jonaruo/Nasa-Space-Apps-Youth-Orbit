## üöÄ Overview
We are a group of youths interested in the idea of commercializing Low Earth Orbit and the concept of giving sufficient access for the future expansion and industrialization of space.

Our idea is to enable cost-efficient, flexible, and sustainable access to Low Earth Orbit using decommissioned and older planes as an air-launch platform, made to jump start launching capabilities and expanding the access to Low Earth Orbit starting with Indonesia and regional South East Asia launch capabilities, with scalability potential to global launch capabilities.

## üß© Problem Statement
Low Earth Orbit house a massive potential in terms of economic and industrial growth, it's commercialization would add a historic breakthrough in major industries, however such growth are impeded by limited launch capabilities that we have currently. We see this problem jarringly obvious in the South East Asia region, which does not have any regional launch capability, despite it's optimal place on the equator as a launching platform.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to expand the access for governments, businesses, start-ups and groups or people who are interested in establishing a presence in Low Earth Orbit, starting with Indonesia, the region of South East Asia and eventually to the global market.

## üí° Our Solution
Our solution to this problem is to provide optimal and effective access to Low Earth Orbit using decommissioned aircraft for low-cost LEO launches. We hope by utilizing decommissioned aircraft we could start building up the necessary industry and infrastructure to start commercializing a launch platform in the region.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Why Air-Launch?
Traditional ground-based launches require heavy infrastructure, costly fuel, and clear weather windows. In contrast, the air-launch method offers several key advantages:
- **Cost Efficiency:** Launching from an aircraft reduces fuel requirements by starting at high altitude and velocity.
- **Flexibility:** Missions can launch from multiple airports near the equator, where orbital efficiency is greatest ‚Äî including Indonesia‚Äôs southern and eastern regions.
- **Sustainability:** By reusing decommissioned aircraft, we reduce waste while repurposing existing assets for space access.
- **Rapid Deployment:** Aircraft-based launches can be prepared and launched within days, not weeks, providing on-demand access to orbit for small payloads.

This approach makes Low Earth Orbit more accessible ‚Äî not just for governments or major corporations, but also for universities, startups, and emerging space agencies across Southeast Asia.

## Our Vision
Our vision is to establish Southeast Asia‚Äôs first fully integrated commercial air-launch system ‚Äî transforming retired aircraft into vehicles of discovery and building an inclusive future for space access.

## Live Demo
In this demo we visualize our system of air-launch platform starting from a favorable airport position in, Frans Kaisiepo Airport, Biak, Indonesia.

## üß≠ Implementation Strategy
Youth Orbit envisions a phased roadmap to turn this concept into a working system:

1. **Phase 1 ‚Äî Research & Feasibility (0‚Äì6 months):**  
Conduct engineering studies and simulations with support from BRIN and PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) to evaluate structural and aerodynamic requirements for air-launch operations using decommissioned C-130 aircraft.

2. **Phase 2 ‚Äî Prototype & Testing (6‚Äì18 months):**  
Develop a scaled prototype launcher, integrating telemetry and separation systems for suborbital demonstration missions.

3. **Phase 3 ‚Äî Regional Expansion (18‚Äì36 months):**  
Establish partnerships with regional agencies (GISTDA, MYSA, VAST) to expand operational testing and begin collaborative orbital research launches.

Each stage emphasizes local collaboration, resource optimization, and knowledge sharing ‚Äî ensuring the system grows sustainably while building a regional aerospace foundation.


# üöÄ Future Prospects & Innovation ‚Äî Youth Orbit
## üå± Sustainable Propulsion and Methane Fuel Adoption

To align with the global push for sustainable aerospace operations, Youth Orbit envisions transitioning its aircraft fleet and launch systems toward methane-based fuels.
Methane (CH‚ÇÑ) is increasingly recognized as a next-generation aviation and rocket propellant due to its:
- Lower carbon emissions compared to kerosene-based fuels.
- Cleaner combustion, reducing engine maintenance and extending lifespan.
- Compatibility with renewable production (e.g., biomethane and synthetic methane).

In the long term, methane-powered aircraft could replace kerosene-burning fleets, while methane-fueled rockets could support clean orbital launches in collaboration with agencies such as BRIN or international partners inspired by Nasa's data regarding fuel. This transition enables Youth Orbit to pioneer Indonesia‚Äôs first environmentally responsible aerospace launch platform.

## üõ©Ô∏è Expansion of Air Launch Fleet (PTDI & Regional Collaboration)

To scale operations sustainably, Youth Orbit plans to expand its air-launch fleet through strategic partnerships with PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) and regional aerospace organizations. PTDI‚Äôs proven manufacturing expertise provides a solid foundation for developing launch-ready aircraft platforms based on:
- CN-235 ‚Äî a medium-range twin-turboprop capable of carrying light suborbital or microsatellite launchers.
- N-219 Nurtanio ‚Äî a lightweight utility aircraft ideal for atmospheric testing and future suborbital missions.

While newer aircraft like the CN-235 remain limited in production, early operational phases will rely on decommissioned C-130s or retired jetliners, enabling cost-effective and rapid testing. As domestic aerospace production matures, newer PTDI-built aircraft will join the fleet to enhance payload capacity and launch flexibility.

Regional collaboration is also envisioned with GISTDA (Thailand), MYSA (Malaysia), and VAST (Vietnam) ‚Äî establishing a Southeast Asian Aerospace Innovation Network. This alliance would promote joint R&D in materials science, avionics, and sustainable aircraft modification for future space operations. This initiative creates a self-sustaining and regionally integrated aerospace ecosystem, where Southeast Asian-built aircraft launch Southeast Asian-developed rockets ‚Äî strengthening the region‚Äôs autonomy in access to space.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Partnership with BRIN for Orbital and Suborbital Research

Youth Orbit aims to deepen cooperation with BRIN‚Äôs Rocket Technology Division, renowned for developing the RX-series rockets and experimental sounding vehicles. By combining BRIN‚Äôs launch expertise with Youth Orbit‚Äôs innovative air-launch platform, the collaboration could:
- Conduct suborbital missions for atmospheric, microgravity, or reentry studies.
- Launch CubeSats and microsatellites into low Earth orbit (LEO).
- Support aerospace and materials research in collaboration with universities and startups.

Beyond Indonesia, this initiative envisions partnerships with regional research centers and private companies, such as Equatorial Space Systems (Singapore) and emerging academic consortia, to accelerate joint orbital experiments, data sharing, and technology transfer. Through these partnerships, Youth Orbit bridges government research, private industry, and academia, ensuring that the future of space access in Southeast Asia remains collaborative, commercially viable, and environmentally responsible.

## üåèGlobal Collaboration and Market Integration

Youth Orbit‚Äôs model can integrate into global networks such as:
- NASA‚Äôs Small Satellite Launch Initiative,
- ESA‚Äôs Future Launchers Preparatory Program,
- Commercial launch-on-demand services for universities and private operators beyond Indonesia and South East Asia.

By connecting Southeast Asian and international players, the platform contributes to a more equitable global access to LEO ‚Äî consistent with NASA‚Äôs sustainability and commercialization goals.
