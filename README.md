## üöÄ Overview
We are a group of youths interested in the idea of commercializing Low Earth Orbit and the concept of giving sufficient access for the future expansion and industrialization of space.

Our idea is to enable cost-efficient, flexible, and sustainable access to Low Earth Orbit using decommissioned and older planes as an air-launch platform, made to jump start launching capabilities and expanding the access to Low Earth Orbit starting with Indonesia and regional South East Asia launch capabilities, with scalability potential to global launch capabilities.

## üß© Problem Statement


## Mission
Our mission is to expand the access for governments, businesses, start-ups and groups or people who are interested in establishing a presence in Low Earth Orbit.

## üí° Our Solution
Reuses decommissioned aircraft for low-cost LEO launches

## Live Demo
In this demo we visualize our system of air-launch platform starting from a favorable airport position in Indonesia
